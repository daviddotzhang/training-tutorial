- you can use keyword to search on google and jira to find the related LPS, you might be lucky to find a solution.

- For the pull request, it will be better to comment why you fix the issue in this way. Also pay attention to the source format.

### Chapter3: How to create a hotfix to the customer ? ###

##### First of all, you need to check with the from Patch Portal. ####
- if the customer has two versions in use, like sp10 and sp15, if yes, you need to confirm with CSE.

  git checkout -b LPS-XXX fix-pack-de-11.
- If customer is using EE62, for example sp15. Now we have sp7,sp10,sp13,sp15.
